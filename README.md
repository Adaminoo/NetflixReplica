# NetflixReplica

This project is my replication of the Neflix homepage for my webdev course at mtech.

This one-page website needs no setup. 
The Netflix logo in the top corner is a link to the real netflix homepage, and will bring you there in a new tab.
Each of the buttons contain a blank link in order to simulate buttons, but do not lead to anything.

I did not implement any Javascript, since I haven't been able to learn much about it in class yet.
